- When a host cancels a booking, the listing does not become available for booking again. However, when a user does so, it becomes available.
- Adjacent postal code means only the last number in the postal code is different
- "we are only interested in ranking those renters that have made at least two bookings in the year." In the year means same year as the year of the startDate
- We generate reports only for listings that are currently on the site; deleted listings, and their associated bookings do not contribute to the reports.
- we must have input (ie. latitude longitude etc)
- SIN #s don't start with a 0
- You must input both a rating and a comment (not one or the other)
- "clearly mention what payment information you expect and store that in your database." We want just card type and card number
- Whenever price is displayed, only listings that have availabilities are shown. In the locations listings search, if price is shown, only the listings that have availabilities are displayed. Ones in the distance specified without any availabilities are not shown.
- For houses and guesthouses, the unit number is 0 by default

- Filter by availabilities: we only return listings that are available for the whole range given
- When filtering bookings reports by date range, we assume the entire booking must be within the date range.
- for max cancellations within a year, we assume the startdate of the booking must be within the CURRENT year
- reports about number of bookings (by city/postal) only count bookings that have not been cancelled
- for counting bookings by city, we distinguish cities with the same name that are located in different countries
